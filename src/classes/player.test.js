// Players can take turns playing the game by attacking the enemy Gameboard.
// first need to make it so we have 2 gameboards: player1 gameboard and player2 gameboard

// discussion with Tom was if we have a class for player that holds name and shots taken we can then use shots taken to validate current move when attacking
// âœ… first check do we create an object of player
// it will need a method of attack
// it will need some way to know whos turn it is - or is this game loop
